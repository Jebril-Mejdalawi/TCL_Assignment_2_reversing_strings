# TCL_Assignment_2_reversing_strings
I'm supposed to solve a simple reversing problem with TCL programming language.

1- I read the string from user
2- I called a function called reverse with the string as a prameter, this function will return the string reversed
3- the reverse function uses RegEx to slice the string into a list
4- the reverse function stores the list in a reversed manner inside a new list (reversedList)
5- in the main I print the string before and after reversing.
